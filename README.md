## Project Overview

The app classifies resumes into categories such as **Data Science**, **Web Development**, etc. It uses NLP techniques for text extraction and classification with a machine learning model.

## Features

- **Upload resumes** in TXT or PDF formats.
- Classify resumes into predefined categories.
- Streamlit web app interface for ease of use.

## How It Works

1. The resume text is extracted using `nltk`.
2. Text features are vectorized using **TF-IDF**.
3. A pre-trained **SVM Classifier** model is used to classify the resume.
4. The prediction is displayed on the web interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **NLTK**
- **Scikit-learn**
